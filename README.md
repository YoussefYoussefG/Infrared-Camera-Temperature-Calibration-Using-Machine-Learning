# Infrared-Camera-Temperature-Calibration-Using-Machine-Learning
A machine-learning–based calibration pipeline for infrared thermography data from FLIR and ICI cameras. The project evaluates multiple models, generates calibration curves, computes clinical error metrics (MAE, RMSE, MAPE), and compares camera performance against reference oral temperature measurements.
